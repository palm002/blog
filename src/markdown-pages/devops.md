One of my biggest passions is DevOps and Cloud Computing.

I love ssh-ing into VMs to tinker around, building pipelines
or simply automating mundane tasks through code or bash script.

Being a part of Digital Engineering practice team, we enable our clients 
on their Digital Transformation journey. Of course, services depend on
the project and its budget/scale but in most cases there is some DevOps involved.

### What is DevOps?

DevOps is a culture that combines the understanding between the development
and operation teams, and sharing responsibility for the built software.

This means eliminating silos between Dev and Ops as well as coming
up with a common set of tools and processes for software delivery -
usually in an agile workflow. It's about bringing the teams together to
achieve a common goal.

### The tools of DevOps

There are plenty of tools out there as seen in the image above which can make it
pretty daunting to get started and I myself have not used every single tool shown
in the picture but that's what's fun about it. You get to learn **_anything or everything!_**
<br />
<br />
You can discuss with your team about the pros/cons of a tool and if the rest of 
them agree that it will bring some sort of value to your project, everyone on the
team will see this as benefit. Of course, it all depends on the needs and if there
is a better tool out there, just run it by your team, otherwise learn it in your
own time if it really piques your interest.
<br />
<br />
But this is what I meant by saying 'working together to achieve a common goal'.

### Doing what I love

After saying all of this I can say without exaggerating that I love what I do. There is
never a boring day. It's on the contrary - I feel very lucky to be able to learn so much
while working. Learning and exploring new technologies, best practices, optimizing what's
already been built -- it all adds up in the end and helps me grow both skills and experience.


<!-- ### A bit about me

I work at Cognizant Australia and we are always looking for DevOps Engineers of
all levels. If this is you or you want to move towardss DevOps, feel free to
take a look on the job portals, or reach out via LinkedIn and I'll forward your CV. -->
